## Description 
<br>

This is an individual project, Where  I developed the frontend of a blog application using React with TypeScript. This project complemented the backend [DSABook-Backend](https://github.com/jagonmoy/DSABook-Backend). By integrating Redux and RTK Query, I managed the application state and handled data fetching.
